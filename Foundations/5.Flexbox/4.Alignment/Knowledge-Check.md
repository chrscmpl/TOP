## **What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?**

`justify-content` aligns the items on the main axis and `align-items` aligns them on the cross axis.

## **How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?**

I give both `justify-content` and `align-items` the value `center`.

## **Whatâ€™s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?**

`space-between` distributes the remaining space equally between the items, and `space-around` gives item equal space around them, making the first and last item also have space between them and the start/end of the container, and that space is equal to half the space between two items.
