## **What are two benefits of having well-written commit messages and a good commit history?**

It allows ourselves or other people to easily know how and why some changes where made with a commit, using tools such as `git log`, and it makes me look professional and cool.

## **How many characters should the subject line of your commit message be?**

Less than 50 is preferred, but 72 should be considered the hard cap.
