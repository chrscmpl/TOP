## **From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?**

First there is the space occupied by the actual content of the element, after that there is **padding**, which represents the space between the content and the **border** of the element,
and outside of the border there is **margin**, which represents the minimum space there must be between the element and other elements on the page.

## **What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?**

- In the standard box model, the height and width of an element represent only the height and width of it's contents, and padding and border are added to that to get the actual size.

- In the alternative box model, the height and width of an element are shared between the content, padding and border.
