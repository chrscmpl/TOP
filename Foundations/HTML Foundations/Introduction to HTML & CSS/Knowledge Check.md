HTML and CSS are not programming languages, because they are only focused on displaying information. HTML is what the main structure of a Web Page is composed with, and CSS is for adding style to the contents of that structure.
Javascript is instead a Turing Complete, General Purpose Programming Laguage, and in the context of Web Development it is used to add interactivity to the Web Page.
